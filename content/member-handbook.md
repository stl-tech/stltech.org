The goal of the St. Louis Tech Slack is to create a space for discussions that will help members grow personally and professionally, create new connections between those members, and showcase the best things about the tech community in St. Louis.

This is the member handbook, a living guide to the ins and outs of the Slack.
If you have additions or changes, please [submit a PR on GitHub](https://github.com/stl-tech/stltech.org).

## Channels

We have a lot of channels on the STL Tech Slack!
Join whatever you like (and don't forget `/list-private` and `/join-private` for channels you need to be a member of to see conversations in.)
Here are the channels that likely won't change, and which everyone should know about:

- **#announce**: Community-wide announcements, mostly about administration of the Slack and to announce new channels.
  Low volume. (and… you can't leave! Mua ha ha ha ha!)
- **#everything**: The widest-ranging channel.
  For everything not specifically covered by another channel.
  If this gets too noisy, you can leave it.
- **#meta**: discussion about the Slack.
  This is a good place to ask questions (is there a channel for `X`? How do we do `Y` here?)
- **#events**: event postings.
  This is mostly RSS feeds from meetup.com with local tech events.
  It's good for discovering new groups!
  (note: If you have an event to announce, go ahead and do it here. We don't do event announcements in the announce channel since nobody can opt out of it.)
- **#jobs**: the job board.
  Please restrict this to primarily job postings
- **#careers**: more general disucssion about careers (resumés, job hunting, et cetera.)

If you want to make a new channel, read the rest of this guide and then do it.
If you have any questions, please ask in #meta.
Please let us know about the new channel so we can announce it for you.

## Slash Commands

Some useful slash commands (entered by typing `/`, then the command name in the chat box.)

- `/admin [message]`: send a message to the admin team.
  This does not mean that you will go on record as having said something, but the moderation team will see who sent it.
  We treat all reports as private by default.
- `/status [:emoji:] [message]`: set your status.
  This is how people get emoji next to their names.
- `/giphy [text]`: search for reaction GIFs.
  We have our Giphy integration set to only allow G-rated GIFs and to allow you to preview the result before posting, so it's fairly safe to use.
- `/list-private`: list private (no-preview-before-join) channels.
  These are private for various reasons, ask in \#meta if you're curious.

Some commands live on a Heroku dyno that may take a little bit to spin up, so you may have to retry.
Unfortunately, this includes `/admin`.
If you get persistent errors, please message an admin directly so we can go boop it after we help you.

## Do These Things

Here are a few things we especially like to see in the community.
The moderation team keeps these as standards for behavior which we compare members against.

You can help!
If you see a discussion getting off track or flamey, please call out the behavior (note: the /behavior/ not the /person/.)
If you're uncomfortable doing that, please contact a member of the moderation team by using the `/admin` command.

On the other side, if you see someone being especially great about these things, tell them!
They'll surely appreciate you noticing, and it makes everyone's day better.
And, again, if you don't feel comfortable doing this personally let an moderator know and we'll be happy to deliver the good news without mentioning the source.

### Show Kindness and Respect

While the Slack is used by quite a few usergroups to organize in-person events, the majority of communication among members is text-based.
This has the potential to lose a lot of tone and nuance that you'd get in a face-to-face discussion! When you're chatting, please be aware of that.
Go out of your way to be kind, and to make sure that the people you're talking to are not being made to feel uncomfortable.

This can be really difficult!
Check out the #interpersonal channel for discussions and tips on how to manage these interactions.

### Have Constructive Discussions

We want you to be able to learn new things and grow by being a part of the STL Tech community.
Part of this is making sure that discussions stay on-track and constructive.
Channel titles are pretty loose labels for the discussions that take place inside them, but the discussions themselves should stay on topic.

A tip: it's fine if you want to discuss controversial topics, as long as they're relevant and don't devolve into flamewars and bickering.
Try having these kinds of discussions in a Slack thread.
Other people can opt in to the discussion instead of it taking over a channel, and they tend to lead to better conversations about difficult topics.

### Keep it Relevant

This is the St. Louis Tech Slack.
Things that are most relevant to the group are about either life in St. Louis or the tech industry.
Sometimes topics are both at once, which is great!
Everyone here is connected to the local tech scene in some way, be it as a programmer, consultant, recruiter, or student.
This creates a huge range of topics that are relevant to the group, and some that aren't. Examples may help:

- **Good topics**: questions and discussions about specific programming languages and techniques, organizing local usergroups, the way people in various social groups take part in the tech scene, and "soft skills".
- **Slightly tangential, but OK**: where to get lunch and other topics that are relevant to living in St. Louis, but not necessarily about technical topics.
- **Probably not**: current events and politics (especially partisan politics), dating advice, how to properly raise cattle… topics that are neither related to tech nor about living in St. Louis.

That said, we're more concerned about making sure people are well supported here than we are in strictly enforcing topics.
So if you want to start a discussion or create a channel, please do!
If you're in doubt or have questions, ask in #meta or DM a moderator or admin directly.

### Be Welcoming

New members join frequently.
Make sure they feel welcome and supported when they show up.
If they're your coworkers or friends, please introduce them (if they're comfortable) in #everything.
If you're new, feel free to introduce yourself!

## Please Don't Do These Things

We've found these things particularly counterproductive to achieving the goals of the community:

- **Sexual humor and innuendo**: regardless of your personal feelings, these kinds of humor make other people feel uncomfortable.
  Please keep your conversation about the equivalent of a PG rating.
- **Trolling and Flaming**: deliberately getting a rise out of someone does not make conversation better.
- **Personal attacks**: this is covered in the Code of Conduct (linked below) but briefly: name calling, outing, and deliberately insensitive remarks are not OK in this community.

A good guideline: would what you're about to say be appropriate for a mixed-company professional conversation?
Would you say it in a user group or conference talk?
If the answer is "no", it's probably not suitable here either.

We're also big fans of the [the Recurse Center's social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules).
Specifically: no feigning surprise, no well-actually's, no back-seat driving, and no subtle -isms.

In addition to the above, please read [Code of Conduct](http://stl-tech.github.io/code-of-conduct/).
The behaviors listed there are used as bright lines for moderation and removal.

Finally, the STL Tech community is not a place for hate speech or hate groups.
If you're a member of such a group (Nazis, the KKK, et cetera), please don't join.
If we find you, we will remove you.

### Consequences

Ultimately, the moderation team has to decide how to handle violations on a per-incident basis.
Things like intentional outing will be dealt with swiftly and severely, whereas a conversation getting a little heated is less of an issue.
We're humans too, not robots.
That said, here are some things we might do, in rough order of severity:

- **private messages**: most moderation takes place in private messages.
  These usually just reminders about having constructive conversations.
  If they're more than that we will try to make it extremely clear.
  It's helpful if you acknowledge so we know you've seen it, but we'll assume you have even if you don't.
- **de-escalating a heated conversation**: "please step back for a while, we can discuss this later after everyone has a chance to cool off."
  If you see a message like this in a channel, that's your cue to back down so we don't have to go any further down this list.
- **channel kick**: asking one or more people to voluntarily leave a channel for a short time or doing the same via admin tools.
  Usually used when someone refuses to step back from a heated conversation or for trolls.
- **ban**:  asking someone to log off completely or doing the same via admin tools.

## Job Postings

The `#jobs` channel is a space that we've dedicated for people to post when they
are looking for work, or when they have jobs.  This section will provide some
guidance and rules for posting in the `#jobs` channel.

### Pinning Posting Durations

#### About Pinning

Slack allows posts to be pinned to a channel.  This provides a way for job
openings and for-hire posts to be kept around and highlighted in a channel after
the conversation has moved on.

Due to the restrictions placed on us by being a free Slack team, the full
contents of pinned posts may not be available after 10,000 messages have been
posted (historically that's meant 2-3 weeks for our team).  To work around this
limitation we strongly encourage you to use a very short summary at the top of
any posting, so that it's useful when pinned afer the full message has expired.

An example of using this strategy would be:

```
Data Scientist IV at Rackspace (DM: @rebecca.skinner) https://goo.gl/abcd

<rest of the message>
```

#### Pinned Message Durations

Pinned messages more than 90 days old will be periodically cleared out by
administrators.  If you have fulfilled the pinned request (filled the role,
gotten a job) then we would request that you unpin the message yourself.

#### Pinned Message Eligiability

A post may be pinned if there is no similar post that has already been pinned.
That is to say, if you posted a job listing last week and it was pinned, then
you post again today, you need to unpin the previous listing if you want to pin
the current one.  No hard restrictions are placed on how often you may unpin old
posts and re-pin new ones, although moderators may request that you reduce
the frequency of pinning our our discression if it appears to be interfering
with the normal functioning of the `#jobs` channel.

In order to encourage maximum transparency in our job postings, we place more
stringent requirements for pinned job postings than unpinned postings.
Aggregate job listings are not eligible for pinning.  Furthermore, a pinned job
posting must not only provide all required information, but must provide at
least 3 of the 6 recommended fields.

For-hire postings are always eligible for pinning as long as the person seeking
employment is a member in good standing of the community.

### When You're Looking for Work

The `#jobs` channel is available for anyone to use if they are looking for
technical work.  If you're looking for work, feel free to post a link to your
resume, linkedin profile, github page, etc.  You may also pin a message saying
that you are looking for work, provided you unpin when you are no longer on the
market.

You should not broadcast your availability more than once a week.

### When You're Hiring

Posting in the `#jobs` channel is a great way to find local talent, whether
you're an individual contributor looking for a new teammate, a hiring manager
looking to fill a role, or an internal or external recruiter, you're welcome to
post about your job openings so long as you adhere to our guidelines and rules.

#### Job Location

The STL Tech Slack is concerned with helping people who are in St. Louis find
jobs.  To this end, we ask that all jobs that are posted be jobs that can be
carried out by people in St. Louis.  This means any local job, or any non-local
job that is full-time remote is okay.  There's no strict upper limit on how much
travel may be involved with a position and have it still be considered remote,
but use your best judgement ("you can fly home on the weekends" doesn't count").
There are no strict geographical bounds for what counts as "St. Louis", but
consider that it should be within a reasonable distance of the greater St. Louis
Metropolitan area.

#### Posting Frequency

If you have a single job opening that you're hiring for, feel free to post it no
more often than once a week until you have filled the opening.  If you're
posting many jobs, we'd ask that you try limit yourself to posting one or two
jobs per day, and no more than 5 jobs per week.  If you are trying to staff up a
very large team, you may be interested in creating an aggregate posting, which
is described later on in this document.

#### Posting Requirements for Individual Jobs

When you are posting for a specific individual job, we have both some required
rules as well as some recommendations for how you post.

##### Required Information

All jobs that you post should have the following information:

  - Remote or On-Site: All job postings MUST include whether the job is
    full-time on-site, part-time remote, or full-time remote.
  - Work Location: For full and part-time on-site roles, posts MUST include the
    rough geographic area of the work site. Examples would include:
    "Chesterfield", "Near Forest Park" or "At T-Rex".
  - Your Relationship to the Role: Job postings MUST disclose the relationship
    of the post to the company or role.  This includes explicit diclosure if
    you are a first or third party recruiter, or if you currently work at the
    company. "Unaffiliated" is a valid option, however any recruiters found to
    not have disclosed that they are recruiters when posting jobs will be
    permenantly banned.
  - The Type of Position: All postings MUST disclose whether they are: Direct
    hire, contract, or contract to hire.
  - Employer or staffing company name: All job postings MUST include the name of
    the company that the candidate would be directly working for, OR, the name
    of the agency that the recruiter works for.  Posting the name of the
    employer is not required, but is HIGHLY ENCOURAGED.  If a recruiter posts a
    job without the employer name, and another member of the community discloses
    the name of the employer, the moderation team will not take any action.
  - Adhere to the CoC: All job postings must adhere to the STL Tech community
    standards and code of conduct.

##### Highly Encouraged Information

We suggest that job postings include as much of the following information as
possible.  While job postings without this information are not outright
prohibited, users who continually post jobs without any of the following
information may be asked on a case-by-case basis to either include more
information in their postings or to stop posting.

  - Employer Name:  As stated above, the employer name is not required, however
    it is highly encouraged that all job postings SHOULD include the name of the
    employer where the candidate would be working.
  - Salary: Job postings SHOULD include a reasonable salary range.  It's better
    to guess at this than to omit it, unless you really have no idea at all.
  - Contract Margins:  For contract and contract-to-hire positions, recruiters
    SHOULD include their hourly or fixed cost margins that are added to the
    candidates salary.
  - Benefits: Job postings SHOULD include a list of available benefits, such as
    amount of PTO, health insurance, paternity or maternity leave, educational
    benefits, etc.
  - Number of positions: A job posting SHOULD disclose how many candidates are
    expected to be hired for the given position.
  - Type of work: Many job postings include a list of technology skills and
    requirements, but do not speak to the nature of the work.  While not
    required, job postings SHOULD include a description of the type of work to
    be performed.

##### Additional Considerations

Job postings on the STL Tech Slack should be crafted to speak to our community.
There is no prohibition against merely copying information from an existing job
posting, but we encourage members of the STL Tech community go personalize the
message for the audience.  In particular:

  - Leverage tools like [joblint](http://joblint.org) to ensure your job posting
    does not contain language that would exclude marginalized people.
  - Avoid terms like "rockstar" and "ninja".
  - Understand [what your job posting is
    saying](https://where.coraline.codes/blog/not_applicable/) and try to be
    considerate of using inclusive language.
  - Participate in the community, don't just stop by to dump a job listing and
    then go silent.


### Aggregate Job Postings

Recruiters, and companies who are looking to quickly grow new departments or to
significantly expand, may wish to skip posting individual listings, and instead
state that they have several different roles available across a broad range of
technologies.  For the most part, postings like this should be treated similarly
to For Hire postings.  They should be short, inclusive of the types of work
available, and limited to being posted weekly.  For external recruiters,
aggregate job postings must also disclose that the poster is an external
recruiter, as well as the type(s) of roles that are avilable (contract, direct
hire, contract to hire).  Additionally, for anyone posting aggregate listings,
we ask that the job poster be available via the STL Tech Slack to answer any
questions.  Anyone creating  aggregate postings then responding to questions
with a request for a phonecall / email will be banned.
